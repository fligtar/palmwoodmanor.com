        <p>We, the Board of Trustees of Palmwood Manor &amp; Estates, welcome you to our home. Built in a previous decade, the Manor is nestled between its namesake Palm Tree and a range of Land Rovers. Vehicle traffic is not permitted in the vicinity of the Manor so as not to disturb our delicately manicured strawberry bushes and world-class dog run facilities. In case you're wondering, yes, all of our literature is this difficult to read.</p>
        
        <p>We hope you'll visit us soon! (especially if you work for Papa John's)
